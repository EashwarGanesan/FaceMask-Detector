# FaceMask-Detector
Built a Face Mask Detector using Keras, Tensorflow, MobileNet and OpenCV. With further improvements these types of models could be integrated with CCTV cameras to detect and identify people without masks.

The face mask detector didn't use any morphed masked images dataset. The model is accurate, and since the MobileNetV2 architecture is used, itâ€™s also computationally efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, etc.).

With the prevailing worldwide situation due to COVID-19 pandemic, these types of systems would be very supportive for many kind of institutions around the world to detect if the person is wearing mask or not.

Inside the Folder you will see the model and the python file for implementation.
